# The problem

Currently, numerous innovations are being produced in Silicon Valley. It has the capital, the best developers, and the infrastructure for rapidly launching technological startups. The problem is that Silicon Valley is the only place on the planet where the venture infrastructure actually works. Anyone who wants to launch startups must come to Silicon Valley, not everyone has the opportunity to do so.

The population of the USA constitutes approximately 4% of the total world population. 96% of the world's population does not have the opportunity to bring their ideas to life simply because they do not live in the USA. Such centralization in one point of the planet is not very effective in the modern world. Excellent engineers and developers live all around the world. The cryptocurrency market, with a trillion-dollar capitalization, is capable of financing any technological companies.
