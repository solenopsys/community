# Microfunds

Microfunds - this is a new concept of financing technological projects. It involves breaking the project into separate micropojects, each of which creates a small, self-contained product with its own intellectual property. This approach is based on the use of smart contracts and open-source code.

## How does it work?

Let's assume you have an idea to create a new type of 3D printer based on your own technology. Here's how this process looks:

1. The project is broken down into individual components: motors, drivers, controllers, and various software modules.
2. Components that already exist based on the Combinatorics and Converged frameworks are identified. There's no need to develop them from scratch; you can simply purchase them or order manufacturing under license.
3. Those components that need to have unique characteristics are allocated to microfunds and brought to Matrix standards to easily integrate them into other projects.
4. Microfunds receive funding and commence development.
5. You create your project using the ready-made components from microfunds.

This approach reduces risks, cuts down development time, and lowers costs because it leverages pre-existing components and standardized solutions.

## Advantages of Financing through Microfunds:

1. Substantial reduction in the risk of capital loss.
2. Preservation of value and control in the event of the parent project's bankruptcy.
3. Minimal expenses when replacing the team.
4. Justified assessment of value due to the use of open-source code.
5. Simplification of the parent project's bankruptcy process.

## Differences in Funding Startups through Microfunds and Traditional Corporations.

| Traditional Corporations | Microfunds |
|-------------------------|------------|
| A corporation is an organization founded on groups of people. This group is structured through the internal framework of the corporation, which encompasses various resources, such as information systems and equipment. | Microfunds are based on intellectual property presented in the form of open-source code. |
| Typically, the financing of a corporation occurs through investments in commercial activities, requiring substantial amounts of money right from the start. | When developing a complex project, it is divided into a structure of microfunds, and funding is directed straight to the microfunds, bypassing the organization. Each microfund requires small investments. |
| The financing occurs in stages, and there is a high risk of project failure if the corporation cannot attract the next round of investments. | Each microfund receives 100% of the required capital at the time of the transaction, ensured by a smart contract that executes when 100% funding is reached. |
| Financial resources are invested in the organization's structure. | Each microfund is independent of others, with the goal of creating a product that can be used by other teams and in other projects. |
| In the event of project bankruptcy, the team dissolves, and a significant portion of the created value is lost. | Intellectual property is standardized for ease of use by other teams. In the case of project bankruptcy, a significant portion of the investments is preserved. |
| Intellectual property can be created based on know-how or patents. | A licensing agreement for the use of intellectual property is included in the source code. |
| Licensing of intellectual property is carried out through the conclusion of license agreements, which is a complex and time-consuming process. | Licensing is done through smart contracts, without the need for negotiations or even knowing who the counterparty is. |
