# Differences 

In contrast to other open-source projects, which are typically aimed at managing 3D printers or CNC machines and are intended for single devices, Converged is focused on proffessional industrial and business applications.

**Examples of such projects:**
- OctoPrint - a web platform for managing 3D printers, oriented towards home use and the control of individual 3D printers.
- Fluidd - a user interface for Klipper, which is also oriented towards home use and has the same limitations.

#### Advantages of Converged for Digital Manufacturing
- High fault tolerance due to operating in cluster mode.
- Automatic configuration and firmware updates for thousands of hardware devices.
- Automatic processing and scheduling of tasks, such as 3D printing tasks.
- Management of multiple devices as one entity, whether it's a single 3D printer or a hundred.
- Centralized log storage and notification of staff about failures.
- The ability to continue working in the event of individual node failures.






#### Advantages of Converged for Business Tasks
- Thousands of ready-made software modules for solving various tasks.
- One-click installation of applications.
- Built-in mechanisms for data exchange between modules.
- Built-in management of business processes, such as order processing.
- Efficient utilization of cluster computing resources.
