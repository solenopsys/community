# Data Storage

In ShockWaves, we use different databases for storing data. Each database is connected to SHOCK Protocol, a protocol that
allows quick and easy access to data. The way people can access data is controlled by two methods. One is using the
security features of the databases themselves. The other is an extra security layer that checks who can access the data
using tokens and rules based on specific attributes.

## Databases
We use multiple databases, each tailored for specific tasks. These databases have a simple structure, are memory-efficient, and can run on various processor architectures.

- **PostgreSQL** - Great for large sets of uniform data. Known for being reliable, scalable, and supporting complex data
types, it's a preferred choice for managing organized data.

- **ClickHouse** - A specialized database for columnar data analytics, built for processing analytical queries in
real-time. Its design is fine-tuned for quick data queries and grouping, making it ideal for business analysis.

- **MongoDB** - Best for storing and managing large amounts of data that don't have a fixed structure. Thanks to its
adaptable design, it can manage different types of data, perfect for fast-paced development and growing applications.

- **Dgraph** - Designed specifically for data stored as graphs and for analyzing connections between data points. Its
graph-based approach is highly effective for detailed queries about relationships, providing fast data retrieval and
analysis.
