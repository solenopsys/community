# Technologies

### Runtime Technologies

**TypeScript** - A modern scripting language with a powerful type system. It supports both functional and object-oriented programming approaches. TypeScript provides significant advantages in complex projects, offering a higher level of control through a rich set of language tools.

**Angular** - An advanced web framework. Unlike the lighter library React, Angular includes a comprehensive toolset for web application development. It is known for its structured code architecture, typical of modern IT systems, and helps reduce long-term costs by maintaining ecosystem integrity.

**Websockets** - A protocol designed for real-time, two-way messaging between a browser and a web server. In ShockWaves, all data exchanges utilize this protocol, enabling real-time user interface updates and reducing the need to establish backend connections in each application module.

**RxJS** - A library for handling events and asynchronous code. It enables the creation of dynamic web interfaces that instantly reflect any changes in the system state.

**NgXS** - An Angular library for state management in applications. It simplifies the development of complex interfaces and is crucial for server interaction via Websockets. Implementing the CQRS principle like Redux and NgRx, NgXS leverages TypeScript and Angular features for code simplification.

### Development Time Technologies

**Vite** - A modern tool for building web applications, enabling real-time assembly without the need for pre-building. This reduces development time and simplifies the debugging process. For decentralized applications, Vite is nearly unmatched as Nx is not suitable for scenarios involving multiple module sources.

**Vitest** - A tool for testing web applications, allowing real-time test execution without pre-building. This accelerates development and streamlines the debugging process.

**PNPM** - A package manager that reduces build time and decreases project size. Unlike NPM and Yarn, PNPM uses symlinks for package installation, significantly reducing build time and project size. This is particularly important in decentralized applications with numerous modules, each with its dependencies. PNPM can drastically shrink the size of node_modules.

**Esbuild** - A tool for very fast assembling web applications, faster than Webpack. It provides a quicker compilation process.
