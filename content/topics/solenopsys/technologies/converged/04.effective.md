# Efficiency and Reliability

Efficient use of computing resources and reliability are built into the architecture of ShockWaves. Maximum efficiency
in the use of computing power and disk space is achieved by utilizing all nodes for distributed computing and data
storage.

## Clustering

- Each ShockWaves node can be used for computations.
- Computations are managed through message queues, allowing for automatic load distribution across cluster nodes.

## Example

Imagine you have a 3D printing business with several dozen 3D printers, each controlled by its embedded computer (like a
Raspberry Pi). When using the ShockWaves platform, they automatically form a cluster. The disk spaces of these printers
are also clustered, ensuring reliability, greater computational power, and large memory capacity for data storage.

Thus, slicing before printing can be done almost instantly, as it occurs across dozens of computers instead of just one.
