# Advantages

### Advantages of Microkernel Architecture

- **Easy Scalability** - Microkernels can be deployed flexibly, adapting to changing load demands.
- **Resource Limitation** - Each microkernel can be restricted in terms of resource usage.
- **Resource Usage Monitoring** - Allows tracking of computational resources expended during task processing.
- **Language Independence** - Different parts of the program can be written in various programming languages.
- **Code Reusability** - Microkernels can be reused across different applications, enhancing efficiency.


### Advantages of ShockWaves for Digital Manufacturing
- High fault tolerance due to operating in cluster mode.
- Automatic configuration and firmware updates for thousands of hardware devices.
- Automatic processing and scheduling of tasks, such as 3D printing tasks.
- Management of multiple devices as one entity, whether it's a single 3D printer or a hundred.
- Centralized log storage and notification of staff about failures.
- The ability to continue working in the event of individual node failures.
