# ShockWaves Framework

ShockWaves is a framework for distributed computing in a decentralized environment, built upon computational
microkernels, high-performance queues, and task routing using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

At its core, ShockWaves utilizes a proprietary implementation of DAGs for data stream processing. The ShockWaves
framework is capable of processing millions of tasks per second and handling data streams at hundreds of gigabits per
second in real-time.

Designed to operate without bottlenecks, ShockWaves encompasses thousands of data processing modules. These modules are
capable of functioning on a single computer or across clusters of thousands of servers.

## Types of Accelerators

MicroCores can interact with various types of accelerators, provided the necessary drivers are available. Here are some examples:

- **CPU** - Standard Processor
- **GPU** - Graphics Processing Unit
- **FPGA** - Field-Programmable Gate Array
- **NPU** - Neural Processing Unit
- **DSP** - Digital Signal Processor
- **ASIC** - Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
