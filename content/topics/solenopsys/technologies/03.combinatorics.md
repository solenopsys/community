# Combinatorics  Framework

**Combinatorics** is an industrial framework consisting of various types of elements:

- Basic electronic modules with a standard interface
- FPGA-based hubs that bring the modules together into a unified system
- Standard connectors
- Standard motors
- Sensors

With these elements, you can create various robotic systems, much like assembling Lego blocks, from completely different
industrial sectors. The more basic modules you have, the more equipment variations you can create.
