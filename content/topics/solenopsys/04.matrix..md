# Matrix - Industrial Design System

This is the world's first open industrial design system. In simple terms, it's a set of rules for developers creating
new products within the Solenopsys ecosystem. The idea is inspired by design systems created by major corporations for
their platforms, such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple.

The main distinction of Matrix from other existing design systems is that compatibility requirements are described using
code, allowing for easy control of their execution and the automation of processes.

**The main goal of this design system** is to ensure compatibility among developments from thousands of companies,
enabling them to work as a unified whole. This compatibility spans different levels, from the physical execution of
industrial designs to virtual interfaces and data exchange protocols.

**What sets it apart from other existing design systems** is that, while design systems from major corporations are
mainly focused on software, the Matrix design system covers various aspects of design and development, including design
rules for physical devices.

# The design system consists of

- **Guidelines** - recommendations on how to do things right and well.
- **Standards** - mandatory rules and specifications in a particular field.
- **Protocols** - agreements on how devices or components interact and exchange data.

The system is flexible, open, and scalable. There can be many standards and specifications, each with its own name and
standard description. Standards and specifications will evolve with the introduction of new versions and the addition of
new elements. Since the platform is open, new standards will be added as needed.

## Examples of standards

### Virtual

- Visual interface
- Data exchange protocols (wireless, ...)
- Module interaction interfaces
- Component rules

### Physical

- Connector interfaces
- Physical connectors
- Data exchange protocols between devices
- Module sizes
- Industrial design guidelines
