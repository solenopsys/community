# Platform Modules

The platform is built on the Converged and ShockWaves frameworks, comprising various modules that form the core functionality of the platform.

- **Converged** - Modules for the visual interface.
- **ShockWaves** - Modules for data handling and distributed computing.

## Converged Modules

Converged modules primarily focus on the visual interface and mostly store data in IPFS.
