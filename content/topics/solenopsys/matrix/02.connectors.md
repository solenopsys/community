# Connectors

## How much do modern industrial connectors cost?
Connectors are a highly technological area in industry. The reliability of complex systems depends directly on the reliability of the connectors that link the system's modules.

Modern industrial connectors can cost tens of dollars each and are not always technologically advanced enough to create cables using them on automated assembly lines. Cable assembly is often done manually.

The cost of an industrial connector is approximately $20. In comparison, the cost of a display port connector is about $2, while the quality and technological level are almost the same.

## Why are industrial connectors so important?
When creating complex industrial equipment that includes dozens or hundreds of electronic modules, the system's reliability is determined by the modules' reliability by 50%, and the other 50% depends on the connectors. For this reason, the cost of connectors can reach up to $1000 each.

## Why do we need to solve the problem of industrial connectors?
Combinatorics is a framework for creating digital factories, and any digital factory includes thousands of interconnected modules. Therefore, without solving the issue of standardized connectors, it is challenging to achieve a high-quality implementation of digital factory technology.

To create a scalable and reliable infrastructure, we need universal connectors with a very low cost, as otherwise, the cost of these connectors will significantly impact the overall system cost.

As an example, the cost of simple devices like temperature sensors or limit switches can be $0.1, so the connector's cost should not exceed the device's cost. With connectors priced at $20, it may seem like an unsolvable problem, but there are excellent opportunities in the market to address this issue.

Various computer connectors that are widely produced and available at a minimal cost are now prevalent.

## Why can we create the required connector?
Developing several types of connectors for a large community and making them an open standard is not a significant challenge. These connectors can be manufactured in quantities of 10,000 pieces.
