#### M2E Power

Next to each M2E connector, there are 2 bolts designed for securing the module and transferring 24 volts. The maximum
power for one connector is 1000W at 24V and 40A. For power levels exceeding 1000W, high-voltage, high-current busbars
are used on the connectors, and power transfer is achieved through spring contacts. The M.2 board has a 3.3V power
supply. When using high voltages and working with the network, galvanic isolation is established with communication
through digital isolators.
