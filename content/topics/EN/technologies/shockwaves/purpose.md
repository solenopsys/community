# Purpose of ShockWaves

The future of engineering development lies in the synthesis of design through AI or high-performance computing.

The goal of ShockWaves is to provide community members with computational power that is currently only available to
large corporations.

Computations span diverse tasks. Machine learning includes PCB tracing, CNC handles 3D printing, and software deals with
program configurations. Generative design optimizes 3D printing. Physical process simulation models electromagnetics,
materials, and mechanics. Electronics simulation covers circuit operations. Data analysis processes sensor and log data
for insights. These tasks collectively define the broad spectrum of computational applications.
