# Smart Modules

Smart modules are a key component of the Combinatorics architecture. Each module features an embedded microcontroller
and two UIC connectors, allowing them to be linked in chains. One connector is used for data input, while the other
connects to the next smart module.

Regardless of the cost of the sensor included in the smart module, even if it's as low as one cent, the module is always
equipped with a microcontroller and an industrial UIC connector. Despite the higher cost, this approach offers several
benefits that justify the expense, such as reduced installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting time for personnel.

## Advantages of Smart Modules

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**: All connectors in the system are identical and have a standardized interface,
simplifying device connection to just plugging in a cord, with the rest managed by software.

**Transactional Data Transfer Interface**: Ensures certainty in device communication. There are only two outcomes:
successful or unsuccessful data transfer. Analog interfaces, prone to various interferences, can lead to rare but
damaging failures. Such faults are hard to diagnose.

**Continuous Device Monitoring**: Prevents a range of equipment malfunctions during operation. For example, a mechanical
limit switch with a broken wire will only be detected during operation. With smart modules, such issues are diagnosed
before the device starts working.

**Serial Module Connection**: Significantly reduces the number of wires needed for device connections.

**Reprogrammable Smart Modules**: Can change their operational algorithms through firmware updates.
