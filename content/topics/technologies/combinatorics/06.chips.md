# Microchips

Solenopsys community is on a mission to design our own microchips. Our aim is to develop chips that are tailor-made for
the demands of modern industrial automation.

**Why is Creating Custom Chips Important?**
Modern chips offer complex functionalities beyond the reach of traditional circuit board designs. This is particularly crucial for developing high-frequency (RF) devices, where the physical constraints and electrical properties of standard circuit board elements are unsuitable.

**Outdated Industrial Protocols:**
Current industrial data exchange protocols are severely outdated, operating at a throughput a thousand times less efficient than what modern technology can achieve.

**Historical Overview and Bandwidth Capacities**

- **I2C:** Created in 1982, with a bandwidth of 400kbps.
- **UART:** In use since 1962, speeds up to 100kbs.
- **SPI:** Introduced in 1979, capable of speeds up to 10Mbps.
- **CAN:** Developed in 1983, with speeds reaching up to 1Mbps.

To create new data transmission transmitters at a low cost, custom microchips are necessary, as small-scale FPGA units already cost an average of 3-5 dollars each.

Moreover, the scope of creation extends beyond integrated circuits. Most modern transistors, like GAN and FET, are manufactured using standard lithographic processes. Developing custom microchips is thus a major leap towards enhancing the functionality and cost-effectiveness of various electronic devices.

### Why is This Feasible for the Solenopsys Community?

Thanks to OpenRoad, an OpenSource Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for chip development, the Solenopsys community is well-equipped to make significant advancements in chip design. We aim to integrate OpenRoad with ShockWaves systems, offering our community members a powerful yet user-friendly tool for creating their own chips.

Additionally, there's an active chip manufacturing program at the SkyWater facilities, supported by Google. This initiative enables any interested person to produce their own chip.

### Examples of exists Open Source chips

- **OpenFPGA:** An open-source FPGA platform.
- **Rocket-Chip:** A RISC-V processor implemented in Chisel.
- **OpenRiscV:** An open-source processor core.
- **ZipCPU:** A compact and efficient RISC processor.
- **OpenRAM:** Advanced technology for database processing.
