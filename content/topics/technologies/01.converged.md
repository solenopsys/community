# Converged - UI Framework

Converged is a UI (User Interface) framework designed to create decentralized web applications, similar to how Android
works for web platforms. It's tailored specifically for technology startups, providing a seamless interface that can be
used across both industrial systems and business applications. 

*The name "Converged" reflects its ability to handle
various tasks common in high-tech businesses, symbolizing the merging of different functions and solutions.*

The framework features a modular architecture, making it flexible and easy to expand or modify. This means that anyone
connected to the network can create and publish their own web module or web application. Furthermore, these creations
are
immediately accessible for use by any other network participant. Converged can support a vast array of visual interface
modules, each with unique functionality.

The Converged metaframework is inspired by Vite.js and based on Angular and Bun.
