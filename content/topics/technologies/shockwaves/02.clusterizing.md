# Clustering

In developing ShockWaves, our focus has been on scalability and compatibility. The ShockWaves platform always operates
in a Kubernetes cluster, even if it's running on a single computer.

## Scalability

ShockWaves is scalable and can be deployed on a range of devices, from a basic computer like a Raspberry Pi to a cluster
of hundreds of servers, or on an HPC (High-Performance Computing) cluster in the cloud.

## Compatibility

ShockWaves can be deployed on:

- Any Kubernetes cluster (k3s, k8s, etc.).
- Any cloud-based Kubernetes service (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.).
- Any cloud-based HPC cluster managed by Kubernetes (k3s, k8s, etc.).
- Supports processor architectures including AMD64 and ARM64.
