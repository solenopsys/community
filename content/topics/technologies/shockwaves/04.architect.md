## Cellular Applications

A ShockWaves application is composed of multiple separate applications (micro-kernels) that, during assembly, are
packaged into Linux containers. The deployment of these cellular applications can occur in a single cluster or across a
multi-cluster decentralized environment.

Cellular applications are either built from existing open-source programs or developed from scratch. These programs are
segmented, modified for data exchange via queues, and then encapsulated into containers (micro-kernels). From these
containers, deployment configurations for cellular applications in Kubernetes clusters are created. This modular
approach allows for flexibility and scalability in deployment.

## Micro-Kernels

A micro-kernel is a part of a program that contains one or several resource-intensive data processing functions. If the
kernel includes multiple functions, they are logically unified by a single concept. This segment of the program is
packaged into a container and can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.

The functions within these micro-kernels are stateless between calls. Once a computational task is completed, all
resources are freed. When a function is invoked, all the resources of the container are dedicated solely to that task.
This design ensures efficient use of resources and optimal performance for each task.

## Framework Components

**Microservices** - Modules designed to handle user requests on the backend. They operate as containers within a
lightweight Kubernetes cluster. Users on the Solenopsys platform can create and publish their own microservices, which
are then immediately available for use by other network participants.

**Data Storage Services** - Converged uses data storage services instead of traditional databases with regular drivers.
These services act as wrappers for database drivers, enabling asynchronous interaction with the database via a message
queue.

**Cache** - A distributed cache that operates at the cluster level, storing the states of data processing workflows.

**FlowControl** - A micro-program that manages data and command streams.

**StreamGateways** - Programs that receive data streams at the cluster's entry point, transforming and distributing them
to HostRouters.

**ClusterRouter** - A program responsible for the deployment and scaling of cellular applications across clusters.

**HostRouter** - Manages the computational process of tasks. They enable interaction between multiple micro frontends
and microservices, directing message flows via WebSockets, crucial for real-time event display.

**Microkernels** - Specialized containers for data processing, akin to AWS lambda functions. ZeroMQ technology is used
for data exchange between microkernels. Within a single node (computer), data exchange can reach speeds of three million
messages per second with a transfer delay of approximately 5 microseconds.

**SHOCK Protocol** - Frontend and backend data exchange is conducted through message streams. This involves using
WebSockets for the frontend and ZeroMQ within the cluster.
