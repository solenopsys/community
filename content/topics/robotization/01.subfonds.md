# Funds

Funds from investors are allocated across various directions, each with its own fund. The primary goal of this division
is to ensure control over the efficiency and profitability of each direction.

## Directions

- **Technologies** - new technologies
- **Microchips** - open-source microchips
- **Synthesis** - high-performance computing based on the ShockWaves framework
- **Software** - software based on the Converged framework
- **Hardware** - hardware based on the Compbinatorics framework
- **Testing** - equipment for testing hardware
- **Measurements** - measurement equipment
- **Production** - financing the production of hardware

### Technologies

Investments in technologies that can be protected by patents. The main focus is on digital manufacturing technologies
and related areas. Fund resources are directed towards technology development and patent protection.

**Financial model** - Licensing fees for technology use.

## Synthesis

Investments in various ShockWaves HPC applications capable of generating designs, conducting computer simulations, and
requiring high-performance computing. This includes AI models, parametric modeling, slicing, chip synthesis, rendering,
modeling physical processes, and generative design for 3D printing in electronics.

**Financial model** - Payment for computations, calculated based on the cost of computing power multiplied by a
coefficient (0.1-10).

## Microchips

The main goal is to develop fully open IP cores: SOC Risk5 + Fpga + NI, designed to control industrial devices.
Additionally, emphasis is placed on various IP cores for measurements and signal capture, such as those used in
oscilloscopes, as well as IP cores for data exchange protocols and new wireless protocols. Basic chip templates are also
being created, including input-output interfaces.

**Financial model** - Licensing fees for the use of IP cores.

## Software

Focus on commercial applications based on the Converged and ShockWaves frameworks. This includes managing digital
factories, quality control, applications for scientific research, drone swarm management, and UI interfaces for
ShockWaves applications.

**Financial model** - Subscriptions for cloud-based applications.

## Hardware

Focus on Compbinatorics modules, such as hubs, electronic modules, connectors, sensors, engines, engineering systems,
and cables. Everything that aligns with the Compbinatorics framework and expands the framework's capabilities.

**Financial model** - Royalties for production.

## Testing

Investments in hardware for testing hardware, primarily electronics for testing Compbinatorics electronic modules after
manufacturing.

**Financial model** - Royalties for production.

## Measurements

Investments in equipment for signal measurement, such as modules for capturing signals from oscilloscopes, logic
analyzers, spectrum analyzers, CDR, and others.

**Financial model** - Royalties for production.

## Production

The fund is directed towards financing the production of initial batches of hardware. This includes projects with fully
automated assembly, such as the production of printed circuit boards and assembly of electronics. Financing occurs only
during the manufacturing stage, after which the batch is divided into smaller ones and distributed to sellers. Financial
transactions are carried out directly with the manufacturer, and batch storage is also handled by the manufacturer.

**Financial model** - Markup of 5-10% for batch production. The manufacturing cycle is about 1 month. The profitability
is 25% of the finished products.
