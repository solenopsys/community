    <h1> Solenopsys: a decentralized Silicon Valley </h1>
    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Currently, numerous innovations are being produced in Silicon Valley. It has the capital, the best developers,
        and
        the infrastructure for rapidly launching technological startups. The problem is that Silicon Valley is the only
        place on the planet where the venture infrastructure actually works. Anyone who wants to launch startups must
        come
        to Silicon Valley, not everyone has the opportunity to do so.</p>
    <p>The population of the USA constitutes approximately 4% of the total world population. 96% of the world's
        population
        does not have the opportunity to bring their ideas to life simply because they do not live in the USA. Such
        centralization in one point of the planet is not very effective in the modern world. Excellent engineers and
        developers live all around the world. The cryptocurrency market, with a trillion-dollar capitalization, is
        capable
        of financing any technological companies.
    </p>
    <h2>The mission.</h2>
    <p>
        To provide equal access to venture capital and technological infrastructure for rapid creation and global market
        entry of high-tech products to anyone or organization anywhere on the planet.

    </p>


    <h2>Community.</h2>
    <p>The Solenopsys community consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Creators:</b> These individuals design and develop technical solutions, turning new ideas into reality.
            They include developers, engineers, and designers.
        </li>
        <li><b>Innovators:</b> Innovators create new ideas, technologies, and approaches. They are the inventors,
            scientists, and experts whose knowledge and imagination help push beyond the boundaries of the known.
        </li>
        <li><b>Investors:</b> Investors evaluate projects and provide financial resources to other community members.
        </li>
        <li><b>Entrepreneurs:</b> Entrepreneurs use investors' funds to create businesses based on ideas and
            technologies from Creators and Innovators.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Financial infrastructure</h1>
    <h2>Microfunds</h2>
    <p>Microfunds - this is a new concept of financing technological projects. It involves breaking the project into
        separate micropojects, each of which creates a small, self-contained product with its own intellectual property.
        This approach is based on the use of smart contracts and open-source code.
    </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>Let's assume you have an idea to create a new type of 3D printer based on your own technology. Here's how this
        process looks:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The project is broken down into individual components: motors, drivers, controllers, and various software
            modules.
        </li>
        <li>Components that already exist based on the Combinatorics and Converged frameworks are identified. There's no
            need to develop them from scratch; you can simply purchase them or order manufacturing under license.
        </li>
        <li>Those components that need to have unique characteristics are allocated to microfunds and brought to Matrix
            standards to easily integrate them into other projects.
        </li>
        <li>Microfunds receive funding and commence development.</li>
        <li>You create your project using the ready-made components from microfunds.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This approach reduces risks, cuts down development time, and lowers costs because it leverages pre-existing
        components and standardized solutions.</p>

    <h3>Advantages of Financing through Microfunds:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Substantial reduction in the risk of capital loss.</li>
        <li>Preservation of value and control in the event of the parent project's bankruptcy.</li>
        <li>Minimal expenses when replacing the team.</li>
        <li>Justified assessment of value due to the use of open-source code.</li>
        <li>Simplification of the parent project's bankruptcy process.</li>
    </ol>

                A corporation is an organization founded on groups of people. This group is structured through the

    <h2>SOL Token</h2>
    <p>The SOL token is an internal unit of account within our system, and its value is approximately equal to 1 dollar. This token plays a vital role in our ecosystem. It is used for conducting transactions among the participants of our network. It is also essential for the operation of smart contracts, making deals on our platform, and accessing high-performance cloud computing (HPC).</p>


    <h3>Emission</h3>
    <p>The emission of SOL tokens occurs only when they are purchased on our trading platform SolExchange. It's important to note that the quantity of issued tokens is not limited. Emission of tokens is possible only if there are no other participants on the trading platform willing to sell tokens at a price lower than 1 USDC. In such a case, SOL tokens will be automatically issued at a price of 1 USDC per SOL.</p>

    <h3>Token Purchase</h3>
    <p>For purchasing SOL tokens, Solechange is used. The payment method for buying is the USDC stablecoin. Users send the USDC amount to the Solenopsys Foundation wallet, and the trading platform automatically conducts transactions for purchasing SOL at the minimum rate among all platform participants.</p>

    <h3>Token Burning</h3>
    <p>SOL tokens are only burned when executing the Hot Liquidity smart contract. This contract has strict usage restrictions and, upon execution, transfers USDC to an external wallet from the Solenopsys Foundation account.</p>


    <h3>Hot Liquidity</h3>
    <p>The Hot Liquidity mechanism allows obtaining USDC tokens instead of SOL when executing a smart contract. This mechanism is designed to provide financial resources for community participants' projects and the rapid development of the Solenopsys infrastructure.</p>


    <h3>Funds Distribution</h3>
    <p>Solenopsys Foundation is a nonprofit organization with the primary goal of developing the Solenopsys ecosystem. After receiving funds in the Foundation's account, a portion of these funds is directed to Hot Liquidity, while another part is allocated to the Development account, used to pay developers working on platform development. A smaller portion of the funds is used for the operation of Solenopsys Foundation, server expenses, and employee salaries.</p>
    <img src="funds.svg">
    <p> Thus, a significant portion of the funds generated through emission is returned to the community in the form of liquidity. Solenopsys Foundation does not accumulate significant amounts of USDC on its accounts and immediately directs funds to infrastructure development. This approach minimizes the risk of capital loss due to hacking.</p>


    <h2>SolExchange</h2>
    <p>To enable participants on our platform to perform transactions with tokens, including smart contracts, and to convert SOL to USDC (a stablecoin), we are developing the SolExchange trading platform. The primary participant in this trading platform is Solenopsys Foundation, and its main function is token issuance.</p>


    <h2>Market Makers</h2>
    <p>Market makers are special smart contracts that automatically conduct transactions between SOL and USDC tokens with a predetermined gap in price. For example, with a 10% gap, sales can be made at a price of $0.999, and purchases at $0.95. Market makers provide liquidity for exchange between USDC and SOL, earning from price differences.</p>



    <h2>Smart Contracts</h2>
    <p>Each smart contract has its own internal token, which functions as a share for that contract. Additionally, each smart contract can have its own logic. Smart contracts are used to facilitate complex transactions between participants. For example, they can be used to create micro-funds for specific projects or venture funds that finance multiple projects by purchasing their tokens. There are two types of smart contracts: regular ones that use the SOL token for settlements and "Hot Liquidity" smart contracts that transfer USDC to an external wallet from the Solenopsys Foundation account upon execution.</p>


    <h2>Crypto Gateways</h2>
    <p>Crypto gateways are legal entities in various countries that conduct fiat currency transactions between platform participants in accordance with the laws of the countries where they operate. This is necessary, for example, for wholesale purchases of goods in foreign countries through the Solenopsys platform. In this process, a transaction involves two legal entities acting as crypto gateways, one located in one country and the other in another country. The operation of crypto gateways is similar to that of crypto oracles, but in the reverse direction.</p>

    <p>When a transaction is concluded, the operation takes place within the platform through a smart contract and is simultaneously duplicated in the real world. Smart contracts generate real-world contracts that are signed with the digital signatures of crypto gateways.</p>
