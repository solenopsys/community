    <h1> Solenopsys: a decentralized Silicon Valley </h1>
    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Currently, numerous innovations are being produced in Silicon Valley. It has the capital, the best developers,
        and
        the infrastructure for rapidly launching technological startups. The problem is that Silicon Valley is the only
        place on the planet where the venture infrastructure actually works. Anyone who wants to launch startups must
        come
        to Silicon Valley, not everyone has the opportunity to do so.</p>
    <p>The population of the USA constitutes approximately 4% of the total world population. 96% of the world's
        population
        does not have the opportunity to bring their ideas to life simply because they do not live in the USA. Such
        centralization in one point of the planet is not very effective in the modern world. Excellent engineers and
        developers live all around the world. The cryptocurrency market, with a trillion-dollar capitalization, is
        capable
        of financing any technological companies.
    </p>
    <h2>The mission.</h2>
    <p>
        To provide equal access to venture capital and technological infrastructure for rapid creation and global market
        entry of high-tech products to anyone or organization anywhere on the planet.

    </p>


    <h2>Community.</h2>
    <p>The Solenopsys community consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Creators:</b> These individuals design and develop technical solutions, turning new ideas into reality.
            They include developers, engineers, and designers.
        </li>
        <li><b>Innovators:</b> Innovators create new ideas, technologies, and approaches. They are the inventors,
            scientists, and experts whose knowledge and imagination help push beyond the boundaries of the known.
        </li>
        <li><b>Investors:</b> Investors evaluate projects and provide financial resources to other community members.
        </li>
        <li><b>Entrepreneurs:</b> Entrepreneurs use investors' funds to create businesses based on ideas and
            technologies from Creators and Innovators.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1> Financial infrastructure</h1>
    <h2>Microfunds</h2>
    <p>Microfunds - this is a new concept of financing technological projects. It involves breaking the project into
        separate micropojects, each of which creates a small, self-contained product with its own intellectual property.
        This approach is based on the use of smart contracts and open-source code.
    </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>Let's assume you have an idea to create a new type of 3D printer based on your own technology. Here's how this
        process looks:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The project is broken down into individual components: motors, drivers, controllers, and various software
            modules.
        </li>
        <li>Components that already exist based on the Combinatorics and Converged frameworks are identified. There's no
            need to develop them from scratch; you can simply purchase them or order manufacturing under license.
        </li>
        <li>Those components that need to have unique characteristics are allocated to microfunds and brought to Matrix
            standards to easily integrate them into other projects.
        </li>
        <li>Microfunds receive funding and commence development.</li>
        <li>You create your project using the ready-made components from microfunds.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This approach reduces risks, cuts down development time, and lowers costs because it leverages pre-existing
        components and standardized solutions.</p>

    <h3>Advantages of Financing through Microfunds:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Substantial reduction in the risk of capital loss.</li>
        <li>Preservation of value and control in the event of the parent project's bankruptcy.</li>
        <li>Minimal expenses when replacing the team.</li>
        <li>Justified assessment of value due to the use of open-source code.</li>
        <li>Simplification of the parent project's bankruptcy process.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Differences in Funding Startups through Microfunds and Traditional Corporations.</h3>

                A corporation is an organization founded on groups of people. This group is structured through the

                and equipment.
